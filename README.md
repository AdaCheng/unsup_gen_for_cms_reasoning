# Back to the Future: DeLorean Decoding for Commonsense Reasoning

This is the **preliminary** code for the following paper:

[Back to the Future: Unsupervised Backprop-based Decoding for Counterfactual and Abductive Commonsense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05906)

We're cleaning up the codebase and making documentations, which would be ready soon. Please stay tuned!


*The code is adapted from the [Plug-and-Play LM code](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pplm) developed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02164).*
