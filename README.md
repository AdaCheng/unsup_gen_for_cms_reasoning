# Back to the Future: DeLorean Decoding for Commonsense Reasoning

This repo hosts the code for the following paper:

[Back to the Future: Unsupervised Backprop-based Decoding for Counterfactual and Abductive Commonsense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05906)                         
*Lianhui Qin,  Vered Shwartz, Peter West, Chandra Bhagavatula, Jena Hwang, Ronan Le Bras, Antoine Bosselut, Yejin Choi   
EMNLP 2020*

The code consists of the implementations for the two tasks, namely *counterfactual reasoning* and *abductive reasoning*, respectively.

*The code is adapted from the [Plug-and-Play LM code](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pplm) developed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02164).*
